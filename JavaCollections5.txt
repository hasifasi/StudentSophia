ArrayList
The important points about Java ArrayList class are:

Java ArrayList class can contain duplicate elements.
Java ArrayList class maintains insertion order.
Java ArrayList class is non synchronized.
Java ArrayList allows random access because array works at the index basis.
In Java ArrayList class, manipulation is slow because a lot of shifting needs to occur if any element is removed from the array list.



LinkedList
Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements. It provides a linked-list data structure. It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.

The important points about Java LinkedList are:

Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.

HashSet
The important points about Java HashSet class are:

HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing.
HashSet contains unique elements only.
HashSet allows null value.
HashSet class is non synchronized.
HashSet doesn't maintain the insertion order. Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their hashcode.
HashSet is the best approach for search operations.

Linked HashSet
The important points about Java LinkedHashSet class are:

Java LinkedHashSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
Java LinkedHashSet class provides all optional set operation and permits null elements.
Java LinkedHashSet class is non synchronized.
Java LinkedHashSet class maintains insertion order.

TreeSet
The important points about Java TreeSet class are:

Java TreeSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
Java TreeSet class access and retrieval times are quiet fast.
Java TreeSet class doesn't allow null element.
Java TreeSet class is non synchronized.
Java TreeSet class maintains ascending order.

HashMap
Java HashMap class contains values based on the key.
Java HashMap class contains only unique keys.
Java HashMap class may have one null key and multiple null values.
Java HashMap class is non synchronized.
Java HashMap class maintains no order.


HashTable
A Hashtable is an array of a list. Each list is known as a bucket. The position of the bucket is identified by calling the hashcode() method. A Hashtable contains values based on the key.
Java Hashtable class contains unique elements.
Java Hashtable class doesn't allow null key or value.
Java Hashtable class is synchronized.
